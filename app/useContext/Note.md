**useContext** is a React Hook that lets you read and subscribe to context from your component.

Let's decode that:

Hook: A special function that lets you "hook into" React features.

Context: React's official name for the "Family Vault." It's a way to share data that can be considered "global" for a tree of React components.

Read and Subscribe: Your component doesn't just get the value once; it listens for changes. If the value in the "vault" updates, your component will automatically re-render to get the new value.
